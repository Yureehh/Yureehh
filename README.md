# Hi there 👋 I'm Yureeh

Welcome to my GitHub profile — where **machine learning**, **GenAI**, and **videogames** peacefully coexist (most of the time).  
Sometimes they even collaborate. Sometimes they fight. We learn from both.


## About me
🎓 **BSc in Computer Science** + **MSc in Data Science** (top grades — I took it personally).  
💼 **Data Scientist @ Data Reply** — I turn messy data into decisions, and occasionally into plots that look *too* confident.  
🎓 **Data & AI Tutor (online courses)** — I teach ML/AI concepts and help people ship projects without summoning chaos.

🧪 Off-hours I build things that start as “quick experiments” and end as:
- 🤖 **GenAI** projects (RAG, agents, eval, pipelines — the fun kind of engineering)
- 🎮 **Game-related** stuff (tools, prototypes, “this will be small” lies)
- 🏟️ **Sports analytics** (because now the match has *metrics* and somehow that’s worse)
- 🕹️ **Reinforcement Learning** (teaching agents skills I still don’t have)

🧠 Interests: **GenAI engineering**, **ML systems**, **RL**, **game tech**, **data products**, and anything that makes GPUs warm.


## What you’ll find here
✅ Projects I can publish without summoning legal  
✅ Reusable ML/data tooling  
✅ Experiments, notebooks, and proof-of-concepts that mysteriously became “mini frameworks”

## What you *won’t* find here
🚫 The spiciest private projects (too early / too cursed / too “trust me bro”)  
🚫 My gaming stats (I have standards. sometimes.)
